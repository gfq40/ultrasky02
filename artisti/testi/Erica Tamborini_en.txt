Erica Tamborini (Milan, 1988) is a sculptor and performer who initially trained at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts and later studied Art History and Criticism at the University of Milan and in the U.S. For several years, she has carried out an innovative open-project aimed at dialogue and the cross-contamination of cultural situations and realities through gestures and artistic planning for a new concept of art.

Among the artist’s proposals are:

Energy of Space (2019), a series of events dedicated to the anniversaries of the moon landing and the death of Leonardo da Vinci, held at Milan Malpensa Airport under the patronage of the Italian Space Agency. This project was awarded the Art, Science, and Consciousness prize by the Infinity Foundation in the Principality of Monaco.
Ritorno a Brera (2018), a trilogy of events sponsored by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and by the Lombardy Region, involving the Brera district of Milan, including the Palazzo Cusani Military Command, the Braidense National Library, the Brera Academy, and the Piero Manzoni Studio.
In 2016, for the University of Insubria, she carried out a project focusing on the emancipatory value of art, donating a work to the university’s main lecture hall. She also participated in the Unity in Diversity international forum in 2015 with a performance and an artwork currently on display at the Museo di Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. She was invited to take part in the Florence Biennale 2013. Her works can be found in private and museum collections in Italy—including the Museum of Plastic Art in Castiglione Olona—and internationally, such as at Huawei in Hong Kong.
