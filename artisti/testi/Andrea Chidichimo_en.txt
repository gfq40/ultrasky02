Andrea Chidichimo (Turin, 1975) began his artistic training by studying piano in the mid-1980s. Starting in 1994, he expanded his focus to drawing and painting, learning and experimenting with color techniques and methods at the studio of painter Walther Jervolino. His subsequent research and artistic output have centered primarily on soot painting and oil painting, with a particular emphasis on the use of new materials (pigments, binders, and supports), as well as on studies of perception, color theories, and the psychic functions of color.

His painting technique merges with his musical and philosophical expertise, giving rise to a hypothesis of a “color cymatics,” which explores the relationship between chromatic and sound frequencies (attrito-phoné), leading to meta-figuration—an attempt to go beyond the visible realm in both scientific and philosophical terms.

He has formed notable artistic collaborations with the Paul Scherrer Institute in Zurich as part of the SwissFEL project, where some of his works are held in the permanent collection, as well as with MACTE (Museum of Contemporary Art in Termoli). Further exhibitions of his work have been held at various foundations and museums, including Fondazione 107 in Turin; the Regional Museum of Natural Sciences in Turin (for the “Inuit and the Peoples of the Ice” exhibition, NUNACARTE section, Skira catalog); MAU (Museum of Urban Art, Turin); the Fenestrelle Fort, Palazzo del Governatore; and the PAV (Parco d’Arte Vivente).
