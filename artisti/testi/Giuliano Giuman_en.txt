Giuliano Giuman was born in Perugia in 1944. His background is in music. He began painting by chance in 1964, and his mentor was the Futurist painter Gerardo Dottori. After an initial period of figurative study, from 1972 to 1980 he worked conceptually on the theme of the “shadow.” In addition to painting, his artistic exploration incorporates other forms of expression, including photography, music, installation, and performance.

Starting in 1981, he focused on the relationship between painting and music. In 1985, he began working with glass, which became the principal medium defining the technical aspect of his art. His research into glass as a material culminated in 2015 with a major retrospective at the Galleria Nazionale dell’Umbria in Perugia. Since 2017, his works have layered oil on canvas, painted glass (fired at high temperatures), photography, and almost always backlighting. He has won numerous important national competitions for public buildings in Italy.

From 1998 to 2013, Giuman taught “Stained Glass Technique” at the Accademia di Brera in Milan. From 2009 to 2012, he served as Director of the “Pietro Vannucci” Academy of Fine Arts in Perugia, where, among other achievements, he reopened the museum and plaster cast gallery and founded a design school. He has held over one hundred solo exhibitions and two hundred group shows in museums, galleries, and public and private venues throughout Europe and the United States.

A native of Perugia, he is internationally renowned for his ability to fuse two noble arts in expressing his creativity: painting and music.
