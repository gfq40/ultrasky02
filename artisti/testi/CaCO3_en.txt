The CaCO3 group was founded in 2006 by Âniko Ferreira da Silva (Ravenna, 1976), Giuseppe Donnaloia (Martina Franca, 1976), and Pavlos Mavromatidis (Kavala, Greece, 1979), following their training at the Mosaic Restoration School in Ravenna. They share and develop a common artistic research path in which the ancient and the contemporary intertwine, seeking new formal perspectives.

CaCO3 collaborates with various galleries specialized in art and design, which represent the group at national and international fairs, and also works with companies in the architectural sector to create artworks for private spaces.

Taken from the chemical formula of calcium carbonate (limestone), CaCO3 refers to one of the raw materials commonly used to create mosaic artifacts, explicitly underscoring the fundamental role that the material element plays in the group’s research. CaCO3 is based in Ravenna.

“Our work explores the relationships between materials of different kinds and the aesthetic possibilities that emerge by altering the fundamental aspects of a means of expression, reflecting through the medium the inherent dynamics of the group itself.”
