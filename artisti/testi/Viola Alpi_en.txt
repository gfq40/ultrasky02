Viola Alpi oversees the design and production of high-quality garments using fabrics drawn from her family’s historical archives, with the aim of bringing the “Filippo Alpi” brand into the present and future. Her research focuses on reviving traditional techniques by employing noble fabrics and increasingly natural dyes that respect both the environment and the individual. She remains faithful to the brand’s distinctive style, characterized by a pictorial palette inspired more by the art world than by the world of fashion.
