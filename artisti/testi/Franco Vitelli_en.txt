Franco Vitelli was born in Sezze on March 31, 1956. He obtained his diploma from the Liceo Artistico in Latina and graduated with top honors in sculpture from the Accademia di Belle Arti in Frosinone. In 1992, he founded his workshop Sectilia, where he refined his marble art by creating opus sectile and commesso works, specializing in the Cosmatesque style. Over the years, he has participated in several restoration projects, including Palazzo Colonna in Rome, the Porziuncola in Assisi, and the Cathedral of Gaeta. He has also held numerous exhibitions; among the most significant was in 2012, when he celebrated the 20th anniversary of Sectilia in Sezze. The event was hosted by Dario Del Bufalo, president of the Università dei Marmorari di Roma (of which Franco is a member), and Vittorio Sgarbi, who called him “the last and the youngest of the Cosmati.” That same year, he took part in Spoleto Arte, conceived by Salvo Nugnes and curated by Vittorio Sgarbi.

His most recent exhibition, Spolia, opened in August 2022 and was presented by Vittorio Sgarbi, showcasing Vitelli’s fusion of ancient and modern in his art.

The artist’s career has been the focus of two degree theses: the first by Gaetano Zomparelli, who graduated in painting from the Accademia di Belle Arti, and the second by Ester Marchionne, entitled “L’ultimo dei marmorari” Magister Vitellius Setinus e la fortuna dei cosmati, completed in art history at Sapienza University of Rome.
