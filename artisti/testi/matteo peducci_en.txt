Born in 1980 among the gentle Umbrian hills near Perugia, Matteo Peducci has been drawn to sculpture since childhood. This natural inclination became a reality when he graduated with top honors from the Carrara Academy of Fine Arts in Tuscany. After completing his studies, he traveled to Thailand, where he served as a royal sculptor at the court of the King of Thailand for over three years. Upon returning to Italy, he founded Affiliati, a space where absolute freedom reigns: an open box designed to continually welcome and foster new artistic languages.
