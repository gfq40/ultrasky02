Stefano Conticelli (Orvieto, 1958) lives and works in Castel Giorgio, near Orvieto, in close contact with the generous nature of Umbria—his homeland—where, as an art designer, he founded Bottega Conticelli in 2007. Fascinated by natural materials such as leather, wood, wool, jute, and iron, he learned all their secrets from a young age and mastered the craft of working them, turning them into ever-original and novel objects that soon caught the eye of those who appreciate contemporary beauty.

Alongside shaping Bottega Conticelli’s creative pursuits, in recent years Stefano has embarked on a more personal and experimental artistic journey, producing one-of-a-kind works that give voice to the most intimate and profound aspects of his thinking and feeling (Cheval Résonnant, Orvieto 2018; Save the Ocean, Trieste 2019; Aria Barcolana, Trieste 2020; Atmosfere di Scuderia and Diego Sanzio Villa Farnesina, Rome 2023). His passion for horses often takes him on solitary rides through the magnificent Umbrian countryside, where he loves to pause, admire the passing of the seasons, search for ancient sounds, and be enraptured by penetrating, one-of-a-kind fragrances.

It is in these moments that Conticelli reconnects with his inner universe—a deeply personal realm defined by essentiality, balanced between poetry and emotion. From this source, the artist draws creative energy, which he channels through his hands into magical and sophisticated works, strong in character and contemporary in style.
