The “Ultra sky” exhibition features a particularly significant intervention by the group CA C O 3, which draws on the Roman “vermiculatum” micromosaic tradition to embark on a path of contemporary research. The artistic operation is based on a fascinating reinterpretation of the original technique, where ancient heritage is set in dialogue with new formal and material solutions, resulting in a successful merger of past and present.

The decision to take inspiration from micromosaic goes beyond merely revisiting a classical aesthetic, embracing instead an experimental approach that involves the very “physics” of the work. Indeed, CA C O 3 innovates the traditional method by using fluid, dynamic tesserae capable of responding to air movement and creating ever-changing chiaroscuro rhythms. This feature revolutionizes the static perception of mosaics—usually fixed on a two-dimensional plane—by infusing them with spatial and temporal vibrancy.

Observing the installation means witnessing a dance of small tesserae that, propelled by the wind, form ephemeral geometries in constant transformation. The interplay of light and shadow, generated by the shifting arrangement of fragments, introduces an element of unpredictability that upends the traditional iconography of mosaic art and broadens its linguistic boundaries. The result is a work that, while remaining faithful to the technical precision and craftsmanship typical of ancient Roman tradition, expands its expressive potential through kinetic components.

CA C O 3’s sensitivity in reinterpreting such a historically rich repertoire lends their work a refined poetic quality. In “Ultra sky,” the interweaving of ancient mosaic knowledge and a performative dimension creates a realm where the public is invited to explore the possibilities of a seemingly unchanging material such as Egyptian blue, yet one that reveals unexpected and evocative forms. This act of innovation enhances the past without falling into mere citation, while simultaneously renewing the language of mosaic art through the lightness of movement.
